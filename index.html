            Hi everyone, nice to meet you all! <br>
            My name is Yun-Ting. This is my Junior year at Hunter College. <br>
            I double major in Studio Art and Media Studies (Concentration Emerging Media). I also double minor in Computer Science and Sociology. <br> <br>
            I do many different types of art, including drawing, painting, crafting, web designing, and more. <br>
            However, I plan to be a graphic designer for my future career. <br> <br>
            I take this Web Production II class because I want to make more advanced website. <br>
            I know how to use CSS and HTML, but I don't know too much about Javascript, so I hope I can learn more about it in this class. <br> <br>
            BTW, if anyone wants to know, I am really good at playing table tennis and love challenges. <br>
            If you think you can beat me, feel free to compete with me anytime. I would love to play with YOU! Come on!
